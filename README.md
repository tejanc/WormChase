# WormChase

A Java game development project exploring topics such as active rendering, and statistics gathering. 

## Rules
Score the point by trying to clicking your cursor on the head of the worm as fast as you possibly can. You can try and block it by pacing obstacles in its path. But be quick! This worm isn't about to go down without a fight.
